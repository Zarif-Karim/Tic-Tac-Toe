Jotting down everything that is coming to my head here!!

Feature:
    - players add nicknames/titles
    - best of 3/5/7 etc
    - swap player symbol between games (first game x second game o etc)
    - Show viewers list (numbers, names)
    - Make viewers chat 
    - create rooms/lobby


Backend todo:
    - create->test timestamp functionality [priority high] needed for viewers time sync, research other ways of doing it


Front end:
    - make responsive mobile design ( maybe start with everything scaling up/down with screen?)

Reality check:
    - get a working game -> deploy -> then add more features (dont get stuck on forever developing and never deploying)
